# Deep Learning Tutorial
This is a tutorial on [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) & [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) that starts from its basics (constants and variables) to implementing different kinds of neural network architectures. [Keras](https://keras.io/) is a library build on tensorflow and [theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) and allows users to create neural networks in an abstract form (i.e. create a neural network by adding different kinds of layers without defining their operations). The tutorial contains same examples implemented in Keras so that it easy to gauge which libarary is more preferable according to the requirements. Most python libraries are based on [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) & [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/). The tutorial uses the python [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) framework with these libraries as a way to manage data.
